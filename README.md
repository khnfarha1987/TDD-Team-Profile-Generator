# Test-Driven Development: Team Profile Generator
Challenge 12 : In this Challenge, we'll create an application that generates HTML files using input from a command-line interface.

# User Story
  * AS A manager
  * I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
  * SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

# Project Requirements
  * Create a command-line application that accepts user input using the provided starter code.
  
  * Create classes for each team member provided and export them. The tests for these classes, which are located in the _tests_ directory, must ALL pass.
  
  * The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:
    * name
    * id
    * email
    * getName()
    * getId()
    * getEmail()
    * getRole()—returns 'Employee'
  
  * The other three classes will extend Employee.
  
  * In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have the following:
    * officeNumber
    * getRole()—overridden to return 'Manager'

  * In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have the following:
    * github—GitHub username
    * getGithub()
    * getRole()—overridden to return 'Engineer'
  
  * In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have the following:
    * school
    * getSchool()
    * getRole()—overridden to return 'Intern'
  
  * Finally, although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.
  
  * Write code in index.js that uses Inquirer to gather information about the development team members and creates objects for each team member using the correct classes as blueprints.
  
  * When a user starts the application, they're prompted to enter the team manager's:
    * Name
    * Employee ID
    * Email address
    * Office number
  
  * When a user enters those requirements, the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
    * Add an engineer
    * Add an intern
    * Finish building the team
  
  * When a user selects the engineer option, the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu:
    * Engineer's Name
    * ID
    * Email
    * GitHub username
  
  * When a user selects the intern option, the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu:
    * Intern’s name
    * ID
    * Email
    * School
  
  * When a user decides to finish building their team, they exit the application and the HTML is generated.
  
  * Call the render function (provided for you) and pass in an array containing all employee objects.
  
  * The render function will generate and return a block of HTML including templated div elements for each employee.
  
  * Create an HTML file using the HTML returned from the render function.
  
  * Write it to a file named team.html in the output folder.
  
  * You can use the provided variable outputPath to target this location.
